Implementation of [ElGamal encryption] and related zero-knowledge proofs
with pluggable crypto backend.

The following protocols and high-level applications are included:

- Additively homomorphic ElGamal encryption
- Zero-knowledge proofs of zero encryption and Boolean value encryption
- Zero-knowledge range proofs for ElGamal ciphertexts
- Zero-knowledge proof of equivalence between an ElGamal ciphertext and
  a Pedersen commitment in the same group
- Additively homomorphic m-of-n choice encryption with a zero-knowledge
  proof of correctness
- Additively homomorphic [quadratic voting] with a zero-knowledge
  proof of correctness
- Threshold ElGamal encryption via [Feldman's verifiable secret sharing][feldman-vss],
  including verifiable distributed decryption.
- As an alternative method to generate a shared key for threshold encryption, 
  there is [Pedersen's distributed key generation][pedersen-dkg]
  with prior key commitments by participants. (Beware that this method can theoretically
  lead to skewed public key distribution as shown by [Gennaro et al.])

## ⚠ Warnings

While the logic in this crate relies on standard cryptographic assumptions
(complexity of [decisional Diffie–Hellman][DDH], [computational Diffie–Hellman][CDH]
and [discrete log][DLP] problems in certain groups),
it has not been independently verified for correctness or absence of side-channel attack
vectors. **Use at your own risk.**

ElGamal encryption is not a good choice for general-purpose public-key encryption
since it is vulnerable to [chosen-ciphertext attacks][CCA]. For security,
decryption operations should be limited on the application level.

## Usage

Add this to your `Crate.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
elastic-elgamal = "0.3.0-beta.1"
```

### Single-choice polling

```rust
use elastic_elgamal::app::{ChoiceParams, EncryptedChoice};
use elastic_elgamal::{group::Ristretto, DiscreteLogTable, Keypair};
use rand::thread_rng;

let mut rng = thread_rng();
// Generate a keypair for encrypting ballots. In more realistic setup,
// this keypair would be distributed among multiple talliers.
let (pk, sk) = Keypair::<Ristretto>::generate(&mut rng).into_tuple();
let choice_params = ChoiceParams::single(pk, 5);
// ^ single-choice polling with 5 options encrypted for `pk`

let choice = 2; // voter's choice
let enc = EncryptedChoice::single(&choice_params, choice, &mut rng);
let choices = enc.verify(&choice_params).unwrap();
// ^ 5 Boolean value ciphertexts that can be homomorphically added
// across ballots

// Decrypt a separate ballot for demo purposes.
let lookup_table = DiscreteLogTable::new(0..=1);
for (idx, &v) in choices.iter().enumerate() {
    assert_eq!(
        sk.decrypt(v, &lookup_table),
        Some((idx == choice) as u64)
    );
}
```

### Quadratic voting

```rust
use elastic_elgamal::app::{QuadraticVotingParams, QuadraticVotingBallot};
use elastic_elgamal::{group::Ristretto, Keypair, DiscreteLogTable};
use rand::thread_rng;

let mut rng = thread_rng();
let (pk, sk) = Keypair::<Ristretto>::generate(&mut rng).into_tuple();
let params = QuadraticVotingParams::new(pk, 5, 20);
// ^ 5 options, 20 credits (= 4 max votes per option)
assert_eq!(params.max_votes(), 4);

let votes = [4, 0, 0, 1, 1]; // voter's votes
let ballot = QuadraticVotingBallot::new(&params, &votes, &mut rng);
let encrypted = ballot.verify(&params).unwrap();
// ^ 5 vote ciphertexts that can be homomorphically added across ballots

// Decrypt a separate ballot for demo purposes.
let lookup = DiscreteLogTable::new(0..=params.max_votes());
let decrypted: Vec<_> = encrypted
    .map(|vote| sk.decrypt(vote, &lookup).unwrap())
    .collect();
assert_eq!(decrypted, votes);
```

See the crate docs for more examples of usage.

## Naming

"Elastic" refers to pluggable backends, encryption with a key shared
among a variable number of participants, and the construction of zero-knowledge ring proofs
(a proof consists of a variable number of rings, each of which consists of a variable number
of admissible values).
`elastic_elgamal` is also one of [autogenerated Docker container names][docker-rng].

## Alternatives and similar tools

There are [several Rust crates][crates-elgamal] implementing ElGamal encryption
on elliptic curves, such as [`elgamal_ristretto`] (this one features zero-knowledge proofs
of correct decryption and knowledge of the secret key).

As mentioned in the *Warnings* section, ElGamal is not a good choice for general-purpose
public-key encryption. RSA or [ECIES] schemes (such as the [`box`] primitive from NaCl / libsodium)
can be used instead.

## See also

- [elasticpoll.app](https://elasticpoll.app/) – an [open-source][elasticpoll-src] web app
  that uses this library to implement universally verifiable voting. (Like this library,
  the website is not audited and should not be used for serious votes.)
